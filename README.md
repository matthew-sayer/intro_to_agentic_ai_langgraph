# Introduction to Agentic AI, MCP and fine-tuning Workshop - Matthew Sayer

Welcome to my intro to Agentic AI, MCP and fine-tuning workshop repo.

This set of workshops, packaged into easy to follow Jupyter notebooks, aims to introduce participants to Agentic Systems, MCP and fine-tuning, and start to demonstrate their application in solving real-world problems.

## Do the workbooks in this order:

### Recommended:
1. Run through mcp_intro.ipynb first and run your server.
2. Run all of the agentic_ai_intro.ipynb steps including the MCP server optional steps at the end.
3. Go to the fine_tuning_unsloth.ipynb notebook and complete the linked Colab notebook to learn how to fine-tune a small language model.

### Alternative (simplified)
1. Go straight to the agentic_ai_intro and run that on its own up to the Optional section at the end with MCP.

## Prerequisites

**_Required:_**

- Python 3.13+ with uv
- ollama

## Getting Started

1. Create and activate a virtual environment with uv (as shown in the notebooks)
2. Run the Jupyter notebook to build and execute the agent
