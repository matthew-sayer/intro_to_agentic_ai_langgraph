    "### **Agentic AI**: An introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Agentic AI refers to AI systems designed to function as autonomous \"agents\" that can:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plan and execute complex tasks by breaking them into logical steps\n",
    "2. Make decisions independently based on goals, context, and available information provided by the system and user prompts\n",
    "3. Adapt dynamically to changing conditions and unexpected outcomes, through the use of LLM-driven routing\n",
    "4. Self-improve through feedback loops and iterative approaches\n",
    "5. Utilise various tools and capabilities as needed to accomplish objectives\n",
    "6. Unlike traditional conversational AI flows that simply respond to user prompts with static outputs, agentic AI systems actively manage their own workflows, determine what information they need, decide which actions to take, and persist until objectives are achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of Agentic Systems\n",
    "1. Memory mechanisms that maintain context across multiple steps, stored in a State\n",
    "2. Reasoning capabilities to evaluate options and make decisions, powered by LLMs\n",
    "3. Planning functions to break complex tasks into achievable steps, through structured Nodes\n",
    "4. Tool integration to expand capabilities far beyond language processing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Traditional LLM applications follow a simple pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "User provides prompt → LLM generates response → Interaction ends\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agentic systems transform this into a continuous process:\n",
    "\n",
    "User defines goal → Agent plans approach → Agent takes actions → Agent evaluates results → Agent adapts and continues → Goal achieved\n",
    "\n",
    "This shift from single-turn to multi-turn, goal-oriented workflows represents a fundamental advancement in how AI systems operate and the problems they can solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **LangGraph**: The Framework Behind the Workflow\n",
    "LangGraph is a framework developed by LangChain that allows users to represent Large Language Model (LLM) systems as state machine graphs. This framework provides a simple yet powerful representation that offers a clear workflow for navigating complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangGraph, each node in the graph updates a shared graph state, which is how information is passed from one node to another. The output of the graph is the resulting state once the end node is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are advanced techniques that allow you to stream elements internally from the graph, we will not be covering those in this example notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn how to set up a LangGraph.\n",
    "2. Use an LLM (Large Language Model) to retrieve and summarise information.\n",
    "3. Build an agentic flow that can perform conversational AI requirements, intent design, utterance generation and conversational flow design.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step-by-step guide will help you understand the key components of agentic AI and show you how to construct workflows that can handle complex, adaptive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Research Agent Graph Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the graph we will be creating in this notebook. This graph represents a conversation design agent with specialised components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Requirements Scientist - Analyses business requirements and extracts key needs\n",
    "2. Intent Master - Identifies and categorises core user intents\n",
    "3. Utterance Wizard - Generates diverse training phrases for each intent\n",
    "4. Conversational Artist - Crafts engaging, contextually appropriate responses\n",
    "5. Combiner - Collects all of the team outputs, and combines into a readable format for the user\n",

    "\n",
    "## The Agent Workflow\n",
    "1. Takes business requirements as input\n",
    "2. Analyses and extracts core user needs and goals\n",
    "3. Identifies key intents users would have when interacting with the system\n",
